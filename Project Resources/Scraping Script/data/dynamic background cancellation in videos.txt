Dynamic Background Cancellation
Dynamic background cancellation is a fundamental problem in video processing. Eventhough estimating the foreground is trivial in static background conditions, estimating the foreground can be tricky when the background is dynamic as well.
In this project we try differrent approaches to detect the background and foreground in a video. We start with classical approaches and try to evaluate their pros and cons. Finally, we propose the most suitable combination of video processing operations to get the most accurate results.
