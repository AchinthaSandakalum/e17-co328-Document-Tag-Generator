OVERVIEW
X-tag is a Smart IR shooting sport.In currrent related product are,
very expensive
Companies with large indoor environments charge up to $10 for a single game.
Not enough game modes/options.
Not smart enough.
Not updatable
Therefore In this Project we build a tag system with a central server and a mobile application.In that manner we were able to
Create a updatable ,smart IR tag system.Also the cost of our system will be very lower compare to current products in the market.
GOALS
Shoot father up to 100ft
And make cheaper to produce
And most importantly we want to make our system smart.
SPECIFICATIONS
There are mainly 3 parts in this project .Xtag gun and the headband to shoot and receive IR,Xtag mobile application to
Choose game modes,initialize the game and a firebase server for communicate with in the game .
Every gun has a cababilty of shooting more than 30m and many features like LCD screen,LED lights,vibration motors.
The headband is connected to gun with a wired connection and it receive the IR signals shoots by other players.
Also Headband has 3 LEDs to indiacate the Team colour and Another LED to blink when get shotted.Those IR receivers and LEDs are locate in every
4 sides in the gun.
Inizialize the gun before the match,selecting the team,battle mode are done with the help of the Xtag mobile application.Gun is connecting to the mobile using Bluetooth.
Finding the shooter,giving scores,join to a battle are done with the help of the firebase server by connecting to it through the Xtag mobile application.
Thanks to our system artchtecture this system is updatable(Can be added more modes more option without changing the hardware) and a smart one.
SOLUTION ARTCHTECTURE
Every player has a head to reserve IR shots and IR gun to shoot IR.
when the platyer shoots he shoot with some data.They are,
Team ID
Damage
Player ID
Every players gun is connected to the mobile application through blutooth.
Every phonr is connected to the our server.
Using mobile application,
gun is initilized.
game mode is selected
Server is used to,
comunicate with the gamne.
As a example Find who is the shooter and ,giving scores are done with the help of
the backend.
HARDWARE
IR emitter
This is the heart of the this project and it is very challenging when we use IR communication for this kind of
purpose
To shoot further we Planned used high power IR
IR emitter - TSUS5202
power=
170mW , 150mA
Since esp32 cant give 100 mA for the transistor is used
BD139
and a lens is used to focus
Diameter about
-
38mm (1.5″)
IR receiver
* SM0038 - TSOP1738 - 38KHz IR receiver
* This Moduile has built in
*
signal amplifier
*
2.5 V to 5.5 V
LCD screen 16x2 with I2C module
* standard HD44780
* 5V
sunder
* Buzzer Piezo Bleeper Sounder
* Frequency 4kHz
* power - 10mA
vibration motor
* 10000RPM Metal Brush
* DC 3.7V 5V
135mA-180mA
And also push button and RGB LED are used.

implementation
Design seperated into several parts for the ease of 3D printing
Fabrication circuit
Used small circuits that are connected to the main circuit for
Switch buttons
LEDs
Vibrator motor
IR emitter
Buzzer
Connections are done according to the NODE MCU esp32 datasheet
BACKEND
Access and authentication
Using Email and a password players can register Xtag
Players have to verify their
Email before signed in
More detail will be on testing report
* It is ideal for our Xtag mobile app.
* Cloud deployment -Firestore
* database helps to store real-time and synchronize game data.
* Firebase authentication library is used for authentication
Storage
Cloud Firestore
Fast performance, high availability, and security
Database
Two main collections are used to store Player data and Match data.
Player collection will store records as documents according to the Used ID.
Match collection will store records as documents according to the Match ID.
Players’ details of each match will be stored as a sub collection inside the relevent match document.
Reasons behind the database
When do a query search in a match, It will be efficient
When player want see his paset, it will be efficient
We can increase the efficiency of the system by deleting
old match data.
There Are Some data in the match,which are useless later
Ex: isready,rescue code
MOBILE APP.
Main Functionalities
How to refresh the screen when players are connected
* Streams are used
Syncing the game time counter
How to set a tempid
How to give a score to the shooter
* Query searching is done by the killed player
