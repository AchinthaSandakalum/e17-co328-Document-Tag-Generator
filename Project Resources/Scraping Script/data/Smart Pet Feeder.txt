It will help you to build the relationship with your pet better and better even you are not in the home. Have you ever been worried about your pet's meals when you are away from your pet? We provide the platform to come up with this problemThe SolutionWhen people are getting busy, they forget to take care of their pets even though they love their pets. Taking care of a pet's diet can be hard if they want to take good care of their pet's health. A smart pet feeder is one of the best solutions for that. It is capable of feeding a pet, in absence of its master. So, though the master is not at home, his pet will not miss his food. Smart pet feeders can be controlled by using a mobile app or a website. A small camera, which is mounted on the pet feeder, allows the master to see the machine's surroundings and observe the pet's behavior. Master can move the machine remotely while watching through the camera, to find the pet and deliver his food on time. If the master is too busy, even to operate it remotely through the mobile app or the website, he can switch on the automatic mode and schedule when to give food. A container that is placed on the machine can be used to store the foods and when the pet is being fed, the right amount can be passed to the plateReal-time visualizationGet the real-time activities of your pet, through the camera .SchedulingSchedule a feeding plan when you do not have time to control it manuallyHD live streamingRGet high quality video frames and using the UI to see real-time activities around.UPTO 4 TIMESFeed your pet 4 times per a dayEASY INSTALLATIONSetup the pet feeder and connect to the UI easilySTATUS VISUALIZATIONSee the remaining rounds, battery percentage and scheduling plan through the UI or the in-build displaySolution ArchitectureThe main device of our system is the pet feeder. It is connected to the Home Wifi and home Wifi is connected to the AWS server through the internet. In order to communicate with the AWS server there'll be a mobile application as well as a web application. Initially the user needs to log into the mobile application or web application by entering their email and the password. After logging into the system, they can control the pet feeder in order to feed their pets. Users can get real time visualization of their pets through the camera which is mounted on the pet feeder. To get a clear view of the pets, users can rotate the camera through the UI. If the users are unable to manually feed the pets, they can use the scheduling option. So they can create a scheduling plan in order to feed their pets at a given time. Users can see the status(Remaining feeding times, Battery capacity) of the pet feeder through the UI or inbuilt display.Data FlowThe users of the pet feeder can schedule a plan or control it manually using the website or a mobile app. Then From the UI, data will get into the Web server and the microprocessor in the Raspberry pi 3 will receive the data from the server. And also the users of the pet feeder can see their pet using the camera, which is in the feeding machine. That camera can be rotated remotely, and the live stream data will be sent to the UI through the AWS cloud. Mainly there are two different control units in the feeding machine.Food serving unitVisualizing unitFood serving unit is responsible for food serving. This unit contains a stepper motor and a motor controller. In the machine there is a food container which has a cylindrical shape and it has divided in to four partitions. To serve the foods, the food container in the pet feeder should be rotated to a certain angle. That is done by using the stepper motor. The raspberry pi will send the relevant control signals to the motor controller and the motor controller will control the rotation of the motor according to that signals.Visualizing unit is responsible for live streaming. There is a 5MP Omnivision 5647 Camera Module in this unit. When user wants to get a real time visualization of his/her pet, he/she will be able to get the live stream data to the UI through this camera. Also a 0.91 Inch LCD Display has included to this unit, and it will be used to display the data such as battery level or feeding times etc.AWS ArchitectureInitially the pet feeder will be configured as a thing in the AWS IoT. Pet feeder and AWS IoT will communicate using the MQTT protocol. When IoT receives a message from pet feeder, AWS IoT will execute a lambda function according to the rules that are defined. AWS IAM is used for Authentication purposes. AWS DynamoDB is used as the storage. It interacts with AWS lambda functions. AWS lambda The CRUD operations of AWS DynamoDB is performed by AWS Lambda functions.Live streaming data from the pet feeder is directed to the AWS Kinesis. That data will be processed using video processing application and converts to formats like MPEG4. Converted Streams will be sent to the UI for streaming.The UI can communicate with the UI via the AWS API gateway. When request is received to the gateway, API gateway will execute relevant lambda functions. Before executing relevant lambda functions, the request will be validated using another AWS lambda function. For that token based authentication is used.3D Design Of The Pet FeederThe Pet FeederThis is the 3D Design of the pet feeder. Mainly it includes a food container and a camera.The Food Container.This is a cylindrical shaped food container, which has diveded in to four partitions and it is rotatable through its axis. Every partition has a opening at the bottom, and there is a path to the food plate from the bottom of the cylinder. To serve foods the relevent partition should be coincided its opening with the path.UI DesignUsers can log into the system using the mobile application or web application by entering their email and password. After logging into the system, they can see the current status of the pet feeder. Status information includes remaining feeding times, scheduling plan and the battery capacity. They will be able to feed their pets by selecting the feeding option in the UI. And also they can get a real time visualization of their pets through the UI. To get a clear view, the UI provides another feature to rotate the inbuilt camera. There is a special feature called scheduling which allows users to schedule a feeding plan through the UI to feed their pets at a given time.allhomeuseradminHomeSign UpLoginUser StatusUser HistoryUser FeedbackUser NotificationsAdmin UsersAdmin FeedbackHardware componentsController PlatformCPU: 4 x ARM Cortex-A53 , 1.2GHzOS comes pre-loaded with python programming languageEnd nodes are connected to hardware interfaces.4GB SD card is used as memory5V main power supplyAs the main Controller Platform Raspberry Pi 3 Model B is used. It comes with pre loaded python programming language. It has 4 x ARM Cortex-A53 CPU which have 1.2GHz processing speed. Has a seperate Camera Serial Interface. Also 40 GPIO pins. Raspberry Pi 3 Model B comes with onboard Wi-Fi network interface which has about 38Mbps bandwith.As the other hardware components, Is has included a Camera Module v1.3 (MD0263), 0.91 Inch LCD Display, L298N Dual Bridge DC Motor Controllers and 12v Stepper motor. There are some main reasons to use the MD0263 camera module such as its high resolution, frame rate and ability to connect directly to microprocessor through camera serial interface. As the other hardware components,It has included an 5MP Omnivision Camera Module, 0.91 Inch LCD Display, L298N Dual Bridge DC Motor Controllers, 12v Stepper motor, Infrared IR Sensor and 5V Realy Module.SENSORSThe IR Sensor will be used to set the food container to its initial position and that Sensor shoul be given a input voltage between 3-5V.ACTUATORSWhen considering the actuators the 12v bipolar junction stepper motor has 200 step per revelution and it is capable of giving a high-torque up to 40 N.cm. Then the raspberry pi camera mocdule will give a Full HD video quality of 1080p with 30fps and if it reduced the quality to 720p the frame rate can be increased to 60fps. And the LCD display will be used for display the data such as signal strength, battery level and next feeding time.Also a motor controller has used to control the speed, direction and rotating angle of the stepper motor. A 5V relay module has used to supply the 5V input to the Raspberry PI from the 12V battery.As the power supply component, It has used a 12V Lithium battery of 3000mAh. Its Good capacity, lightweight, and rechargeability are very helpful to reduce the total weight and keep the machine active for a long time using battery current.Circuit DiagramSecurity Aspects2 factor authentication for login is used as a security mechanism. When user trying to login to the system he will receive OTP to his mobile phone. So If an attacker steals the email and password of a user he cannot login to the system unless he has owner’s mobile phone.Another security mechanism is AWS Web application firewalls. The firewall helps to protect our API from common web attacks and bots.Json web token are used to communicate between API and the UI. After user login to the system API will given a token to the frontend. So UI send request to the API along with the token. So the attackers cannot access our API without the token.BudgetProgressSIGNUP AND LOGINPlay VideoPlayCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time -:-Progress: NaN%Non-FullscreenUSER FUNCTIONALITIESPlay VideoPlayCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time -:-Progress: NaN%Non-FullscreenADMIN FUNCTIONALITIESPlay VideoPlayCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time -:-Progress: NaN%Non-FullscreenMOBILE APPLICATIONPlay VideoPlayCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time -:-Progress: NaN%Non-FullscreenIOT CONNECTIVITYPlay VideoPlayCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time -:-Progress: NaN%Non-FullscreenTestingSOFTWARE TESTINGPlay VideoPlayCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time -:-Progress: NaN%Non-FullscreenSECURITY TESTINGAPI TESTINGPlay VideoPlayCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time -:-Progress: NaN%Non-FullscreenE2E TESTINGPlay VideoPlayCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time -:-Progress: NaN%Non-FullscreenTesting ResultsPlay VideoPlayCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time -:-Progress: NaN%Non-FullscreenTimelineProject Proposal(Milestone 1)Presenting our project proposal was the first milestone.19th July, 2021Design 3D ModelsDesign 3D models of the pet feeder.25th July, 2021Circuit & Software DesignDesign block diagrams, circuit diagrams, database schema, UI.
