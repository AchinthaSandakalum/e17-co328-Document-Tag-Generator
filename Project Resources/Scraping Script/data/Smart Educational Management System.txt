Introduction
Smart Educational Management System (SEMS) is specially designed for schools, colleges and institutes to automate the institutional processes. Use of SEMS makes your institution eco-friendly as all data and your reports are stored on the server, the use of paper and files are necessary only when needed. Attendance of students can be marked by taking the fingerprint using a device with an embedded system. SEMS is very affordable and comes with no limits on the number of students, teachers and parent logins. This system is highly secured and the automation helps in reducing costs and brings a lot of savings for you.
