What is the Remote Proctoring Device?
A single device which integrates the hardware and software components needed to conduct an examination in the currently implemented system, which will provide a seamless process for the proctors and students involved in an examination.
why
Why do we need a seperate device?
When conducting examinations where the skills of the students should be evaluated in a limited timeframe, it's crucial to manage the external factors affecting the performance of the students at a satisfactory level. However it could be
challenging to manage these factors in an online environment.
Currently, multiple hardware devices and software tools are used to conduct online examinations while ensuring the quality of the examinations. We have noticed that this method can cause a lot of distractions and unnecessary
burdens to students as well as proctors.
System Overview
What Are The Technology We Use
System
The device on the student's side is capable of capturing the video and audio stream from students continuously even incase of a power failure. The proctor will be able to monitor the video and audio streams captured
from all the students facing an examination through the browser application in the proctor's side.
High-Level System Overview
Method used to ensure secure video/audio streaming:HTTPS protects the user from “Man-in-the-Middle” attacks where hackers can use vulnerabilities in public networks to steal data transmitted to the viewer. Using HLS
encryption to mask a user's connection with the website can prevent this sort of attack.
Technology Stack
The system consists of three main endpoints...
Web browser in Proctor's end
Desktop application in Student's end
Database and server application hosted on the Cloud
Timeline

Security
Security is a key concern in our product since we deal with highly sensitive data related to examinations and personal security.
We ensure security using 3 main methods.
Isolation
Encyrption
Authorization and authentication
Security
Data Encryption
Encryption in Server and Database
The secure MongoDB, Atlas cluster ensures secure data encryption both at transit and rest using TSL and AES-256 standards
Encryption in Jitsi-Meet server
Jitsi-Meet provides end-to-end and hop-to-hop encryption for multiparty conferences.
The meeting rooms are password protected and ephemeral.
Encrypting locally stored videos
To ensure that students or any other third party cannot tamper locally stored recordings, they are encrypted using AES-256.
Node.js's built-in cipher class File-encrypter is used to encrypt the recordings.
AWS Key Management Service is used to control and manage the encryption keys.
