More than a hundred million land mines are scattered around the world which remain hazardous for years even after conflict termination posing a significant threat to civilians and the economy. More Effective and sophisticated tools to detect, locate and deactivate landmines are urgently needed to make lands safer for humans to use.ProblemCurrently available demining methods which include humanitarian and mechanical demining utilize manual prodders or metal detectors operated by humans and mine clearing machines respectively to detect the location of mines. This conventional methods are labor intensive, expensive, time consuming and possess high risk for the humans and machines involved in the process.SolutionWe introduce 'The Landmine Detection Robot' that accurately detects mines through sensors and send the GPS coordinates of the specific locations where mines are located to the server where a map of the mine field is updated. The deployment of multiple Mine Detection Robots to the mine field facilitates finding a safe pathway through the mine fields safely and efficiently without any human involvement making the challenging process of demining easier than ever.Solution ArchitectureWeb ApplicationThe Web Applciation is hosted using Amplify Serverless methods. Acts as the access point for all the users in the User Groups. After logging in users can access either modular front page for controling a spcific robot or User Admin Page related to a group who has all data access.Considering control page for a specific robot a detail entry point and control options will be available along with graphical representation of search area maps.Automated RobotIs the main hardware component of the project. Includes a core functionality of landmine detection, autonoumus navigation and data exchange. Accoring to tha main data flow the key aspects of the robot will be, accepting cordinates from server, storing a data structures to maintain search area details, passive landmine detection while navigatting through the path while updating the data and sending back data to the servers.Web ServerThe backend servers acts as an immediate between the hardware component and user all while doing essential tasks of data storing , calculating parameters and orgainzing inputs and outputs. When the inital inputs received from user server cloud functions would calculate intial boundaries for search area and relevent parameters for setting up the search.Once the search starts the robot updates data stored here to give a real time like data accessability for the users.DATA FLOWData Flow Generation at the user interfaceInserts GPS cordinates
along with a search area. The data will be sent to the servers as raw inputWhen recieved cloud functions would run within the backend to calculate relevent boundaries of given search area in the real environmentThese values will be stored at the servers and at the same time send calculated values to the robot through the established networkWhen received a data structure would be created within the Robot to keep track of the path it travelled, Landmine locations, boundaries.While travelling the details of the search would first be stored at the local data structure. Then with timed HTTP requests would send the updates of the data to the backendThe received values would get stored at the servers, and also providing read access to the webserver for the updated dataWhen data received a virtual map drawn to represent the location data gets drwan at the user interface.

Also an atmel chip is used as a slave for controlling motors and interrupt generator for the metal detector. One aster being the ESP32 handles the calculations while the second master the atmel chip is responsible for communiation and data buffering. The data would be stored in an SD card using the SPI conncetion protocol. Communication happens through the SIM900A GSM module using the UART protocol.PowerThere are three main power lines within the robot. A 5V power line for some sensors that require it and a 3.3V power line for specific components which needs it for optimum performance. Such as the ESP32 , GY80 and the NEO8M. The dedicated 12V would be for the motors and the metal detector. The power for the whole system will be provided using a LiPo 12V 10000mAh battery and voltage regulators will be used to get required voltages.Software Designcloud architectureUser is interacted with our front end which is hosted in AWS amplify. Authentication and authorization happen using cognito pools and identity groups. In the event of creating a user a lambda function is called to sign up a user to a relevant group. With authorized credentials the user calls the API to initiate a new search. The input values are stored in the database and at the same time lambda function is called to publish the data to a topic in the IoT core. Then the robots which are subscribed to the same topic receive data via the MQTT protocol. Returned data from the robot will be published using MQTT and using IoT rule by which the data can be processed. Once the data is received, an aws lambda function will trigger and check for identity and access of the robot and call the API to store the data into the database. And at the same time data is sent to the user.UI designsLogin UItwo-step verificationUser InterfaceHistoryProfileTestingAPI Postman Used to test GraphQL API calls to check for authorization, data manupilation, data type integration. Requests are sent using API keys to validate the requests. Used to tesst Appsync Graph QL requests. Helpful for accessing data elements with varying authorization levels.Lambda function Important when using a serverless architecture. Used to execute functions of servers. Currenctly all defined lambda functions in the system are running on node js. Tests are done to verify authorization roles and accessebility of data on trigger ro function call.Hardware Integration Mqtt Explorer used here to emulate node hardware behaviour. Check for viablity on mqtt messages passed to and from node hardware. Also to check for neccessary trigger aexecution.
