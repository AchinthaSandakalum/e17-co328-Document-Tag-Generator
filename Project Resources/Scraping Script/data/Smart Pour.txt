Smart Pour
An automated coffee machine that is controlled by an app
The Smart Pour is an improvement for traditional coffee makers.
Traditional coffee making is inconvenient with today's hectic
lifestyle. We, as a team, came up with a more convenient coffee
making system that can be controlled by an app.
Features
Make your life easier with Smart Pour
Scheduling
You can schedule your coffee at anytime and enjoy a hot coffee
whenever you want
Ingredient tracking
You can know the ingredient amounts from the mobile application
and shortages by notifications.
Customizing user’s preference
Smart Pour can store the recipes of the users.So you can
experience your favourite coffee without any effort
User friendly interface
Smart Pour mobile application is very easy to handle and it's
with simple structure which anybody can understand
High Security
Smart Pour is high security product only users with password can
operate through the mobile application
Durability
Smart Pour device can be used for a long time and it will
provide you a satisfied service
Solution Architecture
Mobile Application
An Android mobile application is available for SmartPour coffee
machine to allow users to remotely make coffee in a scheduled
manner as well. The mobile application sends a notification when
the coffee is made and reminders for scheduled coffee.Users can
log in to the mobile app anytime to check the availability of
the ingredients to make coff.The app is designed using Flutter.
Web Server
AWS server is used as the web server for the SmartPour System.
Signals from sensors are passed to the mobile application as
well as control information from mobile applications are passed
to the machine and response mechanisms through this server.
Database which is used to store favourite recipes,
availabilityof the ingredients and logs of the system is hosted
at the server.
SmartPour Machine
The coffe making is done in the machine. The pouring of coffee,
ingredient seperation, ingredient tracking is identified through
sensors. It will consist of wireless sensors suchas ultra-sonic
sensors, reflective optical sensors, valves and servo motors.
NodeMCU is used as the microcontroller of the SmartPour and
ESP8266 WiFi modules are used for wireless sensors.
Processing Unit
The Processing Unit handles all the data processing and remote
communications. The storage containers have the ultra-sonic
sensor to track the ingredients availability. The valve is used
to seperate liquid and servo motors are used to seperate dry
ingredients from the storage containers. A reflective optical
Sensor is there to detect the availability of a cup before
pouring the coffee. The machine consists of storage containers
to store ingredients. A heater and motor are used to boil water
and stir the ingredients respectively. The power supply is given
via current electricity.
The processing unit also consists of inbuilt Wi-Fi via an
ESP8266 Development board. Through this the consumer can
directly connect our device to the internet through their home
router and send data to our server

App Demo
The mobile aplication is implemented using Flutter technology and Dart language.
All the features and functionalities have been completed. Some unit testings and validation
tests have been done for the application using Flutter test cases. To enhance the
user experience, a simple design with a user friendly interface has been used.
Back End
For the backend, springboot and mysql technologies are used.
The whole backend is deployed on Amazon Web Services(AWS) cloud as EC2 instances.
Backup services, S3 services and security services given by AWS are
used for this process. This demo shows the relational database implemented for
the project accessed through EC2.
3D Model
This is the expected prototype view. Dimensions can be slightly varied
due to the components of the real hardware.
