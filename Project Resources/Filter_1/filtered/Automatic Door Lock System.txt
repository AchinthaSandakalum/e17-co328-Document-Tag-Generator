Conclusion
Today, security has become the most important thing to be considered. People need a security system to prohibit unauthorized access to their property. Our target is to implement an automatic door lock system which allows the access only for authorized people. It helps to safeguard property from unauthorized people.

Conclusion
Special Note:
We decided to use IR sensors instead of PIR sensors. Because PIR sensors detect all the motions in a wide range. So it was difficult to use in this project.
We removed the face recognition part from our node 2. Because for the high security, recognizing only the fingerprint is sufficient.
